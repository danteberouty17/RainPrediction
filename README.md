# RainPrediction
The project implements multiple different learning models to determine if rain will occur tomorrow 
in a certain area of Australia based on climate statistics. The data is formed by over a hundred 
thousand collected weather statistics, and whether or not it rained the day after these readings 
were taken. The code implements models such as Naive Bayes, MLP, and Logistic Regression.
