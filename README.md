# RainPrediction
This project focuses on rain prediction in multiple locations across Australia. By making use of 10 
years worth of daily weather data, this project aims to accurately predict whether it will rain the 
next day or not. Data was preprocessed to address missing values and to allow for categorical 
columns to be handled. From here, various classifiers (Decision Trees, Linear Support Vector 
Classification (LinearSVC), Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes) and the 
Bagging ensemble method were on the dataset and their performance was evaluated. From here, 
improvements were made to the models. This was done through hyperparameter tuning by using 
HalvingGridSearchCV. The project is comprised of a Jupyter Notebook and the training and test
data used.
